# Curvetopia project - 

The notebook appears to focus on the regularization of curves, symmetry identification, and curve completion, likely for applications in computer vision or graphics. Here's a summary of these processes and models:

1. *Regularization of Curves*: The process involves smoothing and refining curves to make them more uniform and consistent. Techniques such as spline fitting or polynomial regression might be employed to achieve a smoother representation of the curve.

2. *Symmetry Identification*: This step involves detecting symmetrical properties within the curves. Methods like reflection symmetry or rotational symmetry detection could be used to identify symmetrical patterns, which might involve Fourier transforms or other mathematical techniques.

3. *Completion of Curves*: This involves predicting or filling in missing parts of curves based on the detected symmetry and regularization. Machine learning models like neural networks (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) or traditional methods such as Bézier curves might be utilized to extrapolate and complete the curves.

4. *Model Used*: The notebook likely employs machine learning models, possibly neural networks or traditional mathematical methods like splines or Bézier curves, to handle the tasks of regularization, symmetry identification, and curve completion.

This workflow is likely aimed at enhancing the accuracy and aesthetics of curve representations, possibly in graphics, design, or pattern recognition tasks.
